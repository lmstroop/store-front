    <p>Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate<br>
    When I wasn't white enough to use your pool when I was 8<br>
    Stone Mountain you raised me well<br>
    I'm stared at by Confederates but hard as hell<br>
    Tight jeans penny loafers, but I still drink a Bodine<br>
    Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides<br>
    I'm just a kid who blowing up with my father's name<br>
    And every black "you're not black enough"<br>
    Is a white "you're all the same"<br>
    Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes<br>
    'Cause it's oreos, twinkies, coconuts, delicious<br>
    How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?<br>
    I said I want a full house<br>
    They said, "You got it dude!"</p>
